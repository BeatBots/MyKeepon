=== Sensors ===

* Microphone
* Buttons
* Servos (encoders?)

=== Processors and Components ===

* Padauk P232CS14 - http://www.padauk.com.tw/admin/includes/getfile.php?file_name=ZmlsZTEuUDIzMl9EUzAyMUUucGRm

=== Buttons ===

* Front (Touch/Music)
* Body (Head, Sides)

== Line Protocols ==

The two processors in the Keepon robot communicate with each other via
the I2C protocol. A set of pads to watch communication between the
chips is available on the circuit board, in the corner near the happy
face.

The communication is 0V (GND) Low, +3.3V High.

== Devices and Commands ==

The following device addresses are available:

* 0x55 - Servos for turning whole unit?
* 0x09 - ?
* 0x05 - ?
* 0x40 - ?
* 0x60 - ?

=== Device Sleep ===

Assuming no interaction takes place for 3 minutes, the robot will put
itself to sleep. This will cause the data/clock lines on the I2C bus
to both drop to ground.

=== Device Wakeup ===

To wake up the device from sleep mode, pull the V line on the exposed
I2C pads to ground.

=== Sound Sample Triggering ===

Unknown

=== Servos ===

* Device Address: 0x55

Keepon has 4 servos: The main base rotation, right/left body bend,
forward/back body bend, and up/down "squat".

Motor messages are as follows:

------
0x55 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC
------

* 0xAA - servo index. 
* 0xBB - current servo position
* 0xCC - unknown? Seems to be only 255 or single bit values (powers of 2)?

==== Main Rotation Base ====

* Motor Index: 0x04

==== Forward/Back Bend ====

* Motor Index: 0x02

==== Right/Left Bend ====

* Motor Index: 0x00? 0x06?

==== Up/Down Squat ====

* Motor Index: 0x00? 0x06?
