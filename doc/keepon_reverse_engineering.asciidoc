=== Buttons ===

* Front (Touch/Music)
* Body (Head, Sides)

== Line Protocols ==

The two processors in the Keepon robot communicate with each other via
the I2C protocol. A set of pads to watch communication between the
chips is available on the circuit board, in the corner near the happy
face.

== Devices and Commands ==

The following device addresses are available:

* 0x55 - Servos for turning whole unit?
* 0x09 - ?
* 0x05 - ?
* 0x40 - ?
* 0x60 - ?

=== Device Sleep ===

Assuming no interaction takes place for 3 minutes, the robot will put
itself to sleep. This will cause the data/clock lines on the I2C bus
to both drop to ground.

=== Device Wakeup ===

To wake up the device from sleep mode, pull the V line on the exposed
I2C pads to ground.
